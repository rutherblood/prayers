Am I a new being? Am I a new being? Or am I just another old entity. How much of me has changed from who I was these past years? When I see how I wrote back then I hate reading it, reciting it out loud, I feel like an American girl, a sitcom character. That is how I wrote to people over social media. I feel wasted, and not myself. For that was not who I was. I was pretentious back then. How much of that I still am? Have I changed? When my present life is stagnant do I not wish to go back to try connecting with people I have never been successful in connecting with? Is not that challenge passed and given up on? Why are such things cropping up back again? Why do I still think of contacting Bhavika again? Just to make sure I am still not the person I was? That she might now like me? Was all this time just waiting it out? Why only think of her when I am not progressing the way I wish I were. 
Progression is vital. I must keep progressing at all costs. Only take up the past to analyze my mistakes and apply it to new people, for new relationships. Only that is the way forward. How will I progress if some part of me is still stuck in the past trying to win lost battles even when the opponent is no longer ready to play the game and simply does not care? The world is strange thing. I am a progressive. This is me progressing. I must progress. Have a plan. Have an endgoal and a plan to get there. Where is it? Where is my endgoal? Where is the plan I have to constantly follow? Why does it stay one day and is gone the next? Am I new being from what I was tomorrow? Am I new being? Am I a new being?   

The fact of the matter is I have new battles from yesterday. Yesterday's battles lost do not matter anymore. I have won new territories and am ready to take on new ones. I have a relationship. Instead of reclaiming old stagnant feelings I must build on the base I currently have and try making _that_ stronger than ever. Only than can I progress towards the new dawn of my life. Why take down institutions that you have wanted for all this time and got by dwelling in the past and trying for old forts? You have new places to go. Is it not better to strenghten those institutions? For if I am not willing to do it now even the things I have gotten shall be lost and I will be a beggar again. Am I new being? Am I a new being?
